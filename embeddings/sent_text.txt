i guess the first question i had was uh are there flights from san diego to the ontario airport in uh in la or outside la i guess if i
let me see
if there's a real problem there i might keep a car which i'll have and simply drive up
ok there's only two direct or non-stop flights from san diego to ontario and they're both in the morning on sunday
are they
aha
i think i'm going to forget that
otherwise i'd be i'd be routing you through um through los angeles
seems a little ridiculous i think
hi this is b c at www
aha now do you have to be there on uh sunday mo... sunday night or monday morning
aha i... i... it would be monday uh uh sunday night yeah
well there's a like i say a # a m flight in the morning out of san diego
nan no no no no
ok
no no no obviously then uh i ha... as far as getting there i'll do it under my own steam
ok
i'll just keep the rent a car that i'll have for personal reasons uh for that weekend
ok
um
hi mr c
so on the ##th you want me to look at the return
that's wonderful so what it boils down to is just one flight getting out of there
ok on the ##
uh now it wi... will be near the john wayne airport i guess it i... it is john wayne in irvine isn't it
yes yes it is
and um and um as far as i can see we're going to have a pretty full day meeting on the on tuesday the ##th uh i think i ought to be looking at a flight out of there perhaps no earlier than round about # o'clock
ok is this going back to
back to back to san francisco
to san francisco
yeah
i was wanting to make some arrangements for a trip that i'm going to be taking uh to la uh beginning of the week after next see ##th ##th ##th
excuse me there's an american flight at #:##
oh no i was going to say that if i had my choice i'd pick american simply because i've got the uh advantage
mhm
i i'm sorry i my enthusiasm
yeah yeah the um let me see here we've got you on american flight # # # #
yep
leaving on the##th of june out of orange county john wayne airport at #:## p m
#:##
and into uh san francisco at #:##
that sounds great
ok eh let me pull up your profile and i'll be right with you here and you said you wanted to travel next week
ok and that is ## dollars one way
and uh i think that's going to do it those two ho... hotel reservations and and the one flight
you're all set then
ok fine thank you very much for your help
you're quite welcome
have a good weekend
you too
bye
bye now
uh yes uh it i i... have to be in la a couple of different places actually on the ##th and ##th now i'm going to be down in san diego on personal business uh the previous weekend the ##th ##th and ##th
aha
and basically i have to get into eh eh or near the ontario airport for the sunday night and i leave out of the irvine which i guess is john wayne airport on the tuesday
ok um between #:## there is not an american flight there's an alaska air flight at ##:##
mhm
let's see ok the fare we were holding at was ### this would uh increase it by ## dollars so it would be oh my # ##
that's fine you said # ## exactly
# ## right
right round trip
it would not be um it would not be non-refundable it would be a ## percent penalty for changes or refunds
ok um could you give me the flight number on that then that's alaska airlines
alaska air flight # # #
# # #
on out of san jose on the ##th at ##:## a m arrival seattle at ##:##
alaska air
ok terrific
do you want me to book that
yes please do
ok the let me request seating on that one and and then we will go ahead and book for the american airlines the return flight number # # # ok so we'll keep that the same
mhm
all righty and so do we have final approval or or we're still waiting and i do have the travel advance ok so i'm in uh let's see whose record am i in right now
pardon
i'm just checking on whose reservation i was in right now
ok
ok ddd i'm in
it gets into seattle at ##:##
ok
nan
his number then is
ok and for eee
it's
all right ok
and i did give you a charge number on that didn't i
yes you did
ok that's stands the same
ok
at ##:##
and i think that's it so the tickets would be ready for pickup probably um these will be ready well we can run them today now the ## percent penalty fare that will be valid throught the ##th of july
mhm
if you wanted to wait it was just the non-refundable had to be issued within ## hours
um and in order to
did you want to it would have to be issued within ## hours is that correct for for the non-refundable that was the one we were holding
right right
but this but the # ## is ## percent penalty uh we do not have to issue it uh within twenty four hours
that's fine
through the you want to still go ahead and do it today
um just ticket it but i mean it's no rush when when we we get it
mhm
ok
ok
all righty thanks a lot ccc
thank you
all righty bye bye
bye
and once again what time does that leave ##
##:## a m
##:## a m does that change uh the cost
uh let me take a look would they be returning on the same flight th... they would be returning on american airlines number # # # that was... that was a good time at #:## ok
uh for whom
um yeah whichever's cheaper
ok one second are you only going one way or do you have transportation returning
um i'd like to find out the one the one way and the round trip
ok ok uh the lowest one way fare out of san francisco would be on united at # o... ### dollars one way that's with a ## percent penalty
mhm
it's pretty expensive i think it's a little better out of san jose let me give you the fare on that
ok
ok the lowest one way fare out of san jose is pricing out at ### dollars
is there um
there's it it's cheaper actually if it's almost the same price if you go round trip
um for me i wanted to know how much it would be for a one way ticket to las vegas
round trip
um for instance i can get you a ### dollar ## percent penalty round trip fare out of san jose
yeah that sounds good
uh and san jose is a little better market for going into las vegas than san francisco is
ok and what time would the plane be leaving
ok one second here ok i've got departures now looking at specific flight times the fares are looking a little more sold out than than what i was quoting you uh the best one for farewise would be a america west flight at #:## p m out of san jose at #:## into las vegas at #:##
and how much is that one
ok would that just on a one way fare
round trip
ok and returning about what date
to las vegas on what date
um it would be on the the #th
the #th of july
no the #th i'm sorry that evening
the #th ok the very best fare i can get you is ### dollars uh on... round trip and that is a non-refundable fare that's leaving on the ##th at #:##  p m on america west returning on the #th at #:## p m if i bring you back at #:## p m on america west i can get you uh a still a non-refundable fare but it would be ### dollars round trip
ok uh the ###'s good
### at #:## p m
aha

yes please
ok we have you on amer... confirmed on america west flight # # #
on the ##th

it changes so much we issue so many tickets have to wait to the very last day on some of these people ok why don't i just wait i'm going to set these up to be issued on monday that way if he changes again we don't have to keep reissuing tickets
exactly
ok
thank you
hi a this is b
ok thanks b
bye bye
bye
hi b
hi
uh ok um
i need to change um c d's coming back trip from washington d c on the ##th of july
ok let me get his reservation
american express this is a
so we keep the san francisco to newark tomorrow night that's fine
ok
the the number the august #st ##:## the question is how can i get can i get to ne... newark to richmond either thursday afternoon or friday morning early i don't have to be there until about ## o'clock
ok there's uh depends on what you'd rather do there is a piedmont flight which is non-stop from newark to richmond leaving at #:## in the afternoon on a thursday
right
and getting into richmond at #:##
yeah
or if you wanted to go in the morning of the #th um the only
there's no
out of newark it would be at #:## you would not get in until ##:##
a this is b c calling from www
ok um there is one at what time on thursday afternoon
thursday at #:##
thursday at #:## how late is there any later connections of any sort
later connections there's a later non-stop at # gets in at
a later non-stop at #
yeah gets in at ##:##
what about uh and there are probably connections
between the time let me check
between those times right
yeah there's a let's see ok there's a united flight that leaves at #:## um ooh however that's going to be sold out um there's a #:## piedmont that goes through baltimore as a connecting city and gets into richmond at ##:##
hi
same time as the other one
right
all right why don't you book both e f and b c cos we're flying together on the # o'clock newark
richmond
richmond
ok and then
and then if we have to stay later we'll juggle it at that end
ok now what about your
and then we need a hotel to stay in in richmond
ok w... what about your return how many
and why don't you bring up my record
i think he's going to you know i better let e do his own
ok
but that's what i think he's going to do because i think he's going to fly back up to new york and come back on his regularly scheduled return on saturday
ok well right now i'm working within uh within your reservation
within my reservation
yeah
but but uh i'll have e call because he may want to make some adjustments but
ok at the moment it's b c down to richmond on thursday afternoon
ok
on the # o'clock
and it's for which trip
all righty
a place to stay thursday night
let's assume a departure around #:## or # o'clock no earlier than that
ok
on friday to return to either san jose or san francisco san jose is preferable only because i live down in that direction
ok then everything would be a connecting flight either to san francisco or to san jose
right
the only problem is frequency of flights into san jose the
i do like american and i know one could presumably maybe go richmond to raleigh durham
or there's a richmond to dallas is are the connection's offered
the trip that i'm supposed to take tomorrow night
or richmond to dallas
um there's a flight offered but it's at ##:## p m
mhm
um through dallas into san jose at #:## the next flight after that is at #:## uh changing planes it's a united changing planes in chicago and getting in at #:## into san jose other than that the next american's at #:## and it's a change of planes in dallas and into san jose a... at ##
ok all right so that's just american
that's just um other than united at #:## through chicago that was united there is a piedmont flight at #:## through charlotte north carolina it would have to go you would have to go into san francisco though in order to take that
oh but that's about the right time i mean uh
yeah
nan it's it's whatever is going to get me there
right
ok i'll pull that one up all righty
bu... but the time seems to be about right the #:## piedmont
ok
what is it now
it's piedmont it goes to charlotte north carolina as a connection city and then you go into san francisco and arrival time at san francisco's at #:##
why don't we do that one
ok
that seems about the right time
all right then the round trip fare is ## ## again no penalties attached to that
mhm that's
and
ok now here's the problem i just learned today that i'm going to have to go to richmond on friday i have to be in richmond on friday richmond virginia
including whatever i've got going the united flight going out
out right
yeah
that's the total round trip price and what we'll do is reissue um for the brand new fare
yeah
let me give you the flight information
well that's ok
oh you don't ok
i don't need that but what i do need is i suddenly recall that i'm going to back you up and i apologize for this too wednesday night there is no lodging and what i would like to do is to get a room at the marriot in newark airport
ok thanks a lot for callling
ok
right bye bye
bye
american express this is a
yes i wanted to change the uh uh departure date from the ##th to the ##th
ok and did you want to go on the same same flight into raleigh at #:## in the morning nonstop
uh since it would be leaving on sunday it would be nice to leave about ##
ok let's see san francisco to raleigh the only thing i have leaving at noon would be a connection on delta through atlanta it would get in at #:## p_m
ok
all righty then let me confirm that for you and what else needed to be changed then looks like were going have to change your car and hotel
ah yes the uh
how long
we don't need to make reservations in the hotel
ok
hi good morning uh i'm bb cc from www
they'll take care of that um uh i'll need the hertz car and i i i have to make plans to stay through the week so i'd be leaving on friday
ok so friday's going to be the ## and what time of day
about #
about # ok all righty i've got a piedmont flight that leaves at #:## it's a change of planes in charlotte north carolina and gets into san francisco at #:## there's also a us air flight at #:## changing planes in pittsburg arrival is at ##:##
ok ah the cheaper of the two would be fine
ok let me take a look and price them both ok round trip delta and piedmont is the first one i'm going to price and that comes out to a fare of ### let's take a look at ah returning on us air if that's going to make a difference they're both going to come out to the same fare so you've got a choice of going through charlotte north carolina at #:## arrival at #:## or through pittsburg at #:## arrival at ##:##
i'll take the piedmont flight
all righty then that would be a total of ### round trip for the lowest fare and that would involve a ## percent penalty for making any changes or refunds
well i think that's probably not a good idea
ok the non-lowest non-penalty fare in that case would be ####
mhm
ok we'll go with that
all righty and you still want to go with the compact car
yes
in raleigh ok and i'm just confirming that for you right now and waiting on car confirmation ok that's all confirmed and we're all set to go with that when do you want uh to have your ticket issued
uhm oh sometime this week
ok
er er let's see no sometime next week
next week
will be fine
all righty let me let me change it to let's see how about um if we do it thursday of next week or we... let's do it wednesday and deliver them on thursday that way you'll have them before the weekend
and uh let's see i'd like to make some travel arrangements i'd made made some arrangements on monday that have to be changed
good yes yes
ok
since i'm leaving on sunday
ok really ok then you're all set and non-penalty fare let me make sure i can get your seats non smoking windows on all flights
yes i'd prefer that
let's see and let me give you all the flight information too well it looks like we're not having any luck with um ou... the delta flight on the ## the july from san francisco to atlanta the only thing i could confirm would be a middle seat however i could get you the only thing i could get would be like an aisle in smoking nothing in non-smoking except for middles
i really prefer to go the middle seat non-smoking
ok
yeah
then let me go with # # # # one e at least that is a bulkhead seat give you a little bit more leg room there and let me give you the flight information leaving on the ##th delta fligth # # #
ok
# # #
departing out of san francisco at ## noon
ok
arrival in atlanta is at #:## p_m and connecting there to delta flight # # # leaving from atlanta at #:## p_m
ok
and arrival in raleigh at #:## and then returning on the ## of july on friday piedmont flight # # # #
mhm
and that's going to depart at #:## and arrive charlotte #:## where you would connect to piedmont flight # # # # and that's departing at #:## from charlotte arrival back in san francisco at #:## and the flight from atlanta to raleigh on delta # # # i was able to get you a window seat in non smoking
good
and piedmont unfortunately we can't look at their seat maps so i can't tell you exactly what seat numbers we are confirming but i will request non smoking windows
and they're g... and they were to go to uh uh research triangle uh research triangle park north carolina
ok good
ok
aha thank you very much
all right thank you bye bye
bye bye
ok it looks like we've got you going into raleigh durham
ok that's fine
ok now what did you want to change on your reservation
nan this is a
thank you
bye bye
bye
yeah hi a this is b
hi b
could you pull up a reservation for me please
certainly it's flight # # # on the ##th of july dallas to denver and the last name is c nan
nan which is this d
right d
ok uh i want to see if i can get seats for him on those flights non-smoking aisles if possible great thank you very much for your help
um is this going to be business or personal
mhm
but uh otherwise un... unless you're staying over a saturday night
unfortunately no i
ok and what time do you need to be in san bernadino by
i need to uh well my appointment is at # o'clock so it looks like i i just looked at the airline guide it looks like there are two american airlines flights out of san jose ah one's at #:## gets in around ##:## and the other #:## it gets in at ten thirty
that's on alaska
is that alaska
yeah
ah both of them
no american is the #:## flight
this is business and uh
#:## is american aha are there price differences depending on
no it would be the same airfare it's just up to you which time would be better or if you have a preference to airlines
they're both in the middle of the morning so
yeah
equally non-productive uh
it shouldn't be ba... too bad traffic-wise
yeah i guess alaska has a snack on it and american doesn't um
would you rather fly on the alaska flight
well p... p... put me on the american that's a little later that's the #:## you say
aha
and what date did you want to leave
yeah put me on the american flight
ok that's flight ## ## and it leaves san jose #:## a m
##:## ok
ok and then what date would you be returning
be returning on the #nd
at what time
and uh my last appointment is again # o'clock in the afternoon i would imagine we could depart around # # or #
and you wanted to leave from orange county correct
i think so yeah the appointment's going to be right near orange county
ok american has a # p m flight
i'm going to be leaving may #st
that sounds
or they have a # p m
the ## ## is the # right
aha
um yeah i'd almost i'd almost say uh the # ought to be able to do it um
the only um let me just go ahead and price this and double check but yeah you would be eligible for the # ## fare but the ticket would need to be issued today
mhm
so if you want to change that return you'd have to give me a call by this afternoon or unless you wanted to go with the fare that had no penalty which would be # ##
ok in other words if i change the return then i'm
you need to do so by by this afternoon
from san jose or san francisco
ok it's not something that i could uh if i if i changed en route er while i was there that would be a penalty
yo... yeah then it would be a ## percent penalty
yeah i i suspect that uh i suspect the uh # o'clock is ok but maybe to be on the safe side we better do the #
ok
if we wind up having a productive meeting i'd hate to have to push it short for ## percent penalty included
yeah tha... that's true
aha
ok i can confirm you on the # o'clock flight which is flight # # # so do you want to go ahead with the # p m departure then
i believe so yes
ok and we want to go ahead with the ### dollar fare that has the ##
uh it looks like san jose tell you what i what i need i have an appointment monday afternoon at san bernadino and uh i have appointments on tuesday um in the city commerce and in the santa ana areas so
if that's the best we can do what just for curiosity if you stayed over saturday what are the rates
well we could get it down to a ### dollars round trip
round trip ok nan
but that w... but that would be completely non-refundable
no no changes
yeah no changes on a a if if worst now the only thing is that i do need to have the um charge number and the travel advance before we can issue the ticket today
ah thank you so much
ok thanks
bye bye
bye bye
mhm
it looks like probably the best connections are to go out to ontario and to come back by way of orange county i don't know if you split that up whether that's gonna
it won't it really won't affect the cost um except that if we issue the ticket today we can get you a seven day advance purchase that's gonna be two fifty eight round trip instead of two ninety
this is a at american express may i help you
and it's on us air flight # # # # and i believe it's departing at ##:## p m
going where
orange county
#:## p m
yes uh ##:## sorry
ok us air flight # # # #
mhm yeah
ok got that
that right ok now this traveller is making uh this is something out of the ordinary now it says reservations for cc and his wife and
yeah let me make c's reservation and then i'll have to call us air to find out if if we're allowed to make her reservations sometimes you have to make it directly with the airline
a this is b
oh
and if we can make it i'll go ahead and do it
oh ok
ok otherwise you'll have to call us air
oh i see all right now coming back on june ##th
leaving at what time
uh let's see #:## p m out of burbank and this is on us air # # # # and again this return flight will be for cc and his wife
right n... yeah i know
you'll have to check that one too
no i'll check the whole thing yeah
ok what can i help you with b
mhm
what's his wife's name
eh huh
yeah we have enough advance purchase time that i can get a non-refundable fare on the return would bring that portion down to ## dollars one way but i'd have to t... issue the tickets today
no give them the non-restricted air fare i think it's # # # #
non-restrictive air fare # # # # right ok sure
bye
bye bye b
ok my the traveller is c
mhm
first name is cc
ok what does he need to do
ok it's for eh the outbound would be on june ##th
aha
american express travel this is a
i believe so
ok see i don't think they're going to have service that late let me tell you non-stop service the latest would be uh # p m arriving #:## p m
on what day
on saturday
no i can't uh oh let me see what do you mean # p m wh... what day would i leave
ok we... if you give me the days i can tell you the sched...
oh i have a monday morning meeting
ok you will
i want
always arrive the following day so if you left on a saturday you would arrive o... on a sunday their time
hi i'm planning a trip to japan at the end of uh the beginning of july
ok so if i now when could i no when so i... i need to arrive there you know either uh uh their time monday early you know in the middle of the night would be acceptable to me anytime anytime so i can get to an office by i i you know i would like to arrive there certainly before # a m in the morning on monday
ok then you'll have to leave on a saturday because if you won't if you leave on a sunday you're not gonna arrive there till in the afternoon
ok
like about # pm on a monday
is is i... i... if i was to leave at oh i see a... and is there anything late on saturday night cos on saturday i can't leave until after ##:## or ## o'clock at night
well the only the only way you're going i... it's really going to be crazy routing to do it that way but this is the only way to leave at night would have to be to fly all the way to the east coast um to fly to jfk
mhm
and then fly from jfk to tokyo so you'd be kind of going backwards but that's the only way that you'd be leaving at night
ok it's either that
i see so
aha
so you know it's it's either i leave on wednesday get in on thursday or i leave on saturday night so let's see which way we can do this it i... i... i could leave to to uh jfk on saturday night
right let me get the uh schedule ok it would be like a ##:## p m actually that's going to get into newark let me just actually on sunday it's going to go via newark it's ##:## p m arriving newark at #:## in the morning on sunday and then departing newark at #:## a m and arriving #:## p m that's still going to arrive on monday
yeah i think the uh you know
at #:##
no that's no good is are from wh... where are there flights leaving on um sunday morning or late saturday night is there anything from los angeles
okay okay out of san francisco all the flights are afternoon they don't offer any morning flights to tokyo and let me check los angeles ok um let's see they're still going to get you in in the afternoon on monday if they leave there's a flight what airline is this varig airlines at #:## a m arrives #:## p m on monday
no so #:## #:## a m arrives at what time
#:## p m on monday
aha yeah so i need to leave saturday night or around midnight if i leave much after two in the morning on sunday then i i i won't be able to make a monday morning th... th... that's a direct flight so you were looking i guess you could either look under arrivals at tokyo or departures on saturday night sunday morning
no the one i gave you is sunday morning that's the third one
and i have to be there on monday morning i was just wondering what time i uh you know what's the uh the latest i could leave
yeah #:##
that's correct
yeah but that's too l...
that's the earliest they have they don't have anything else um they don't offer as i said they don't offer night service from the west coast to tokyo
mhm
they only of... you'd have to fly all the way to the east coast but you're defeating the whole purpose because you're you're gonna still arrive monday at # # in the afternoon so you'd be flying # extra hours
no well i i i won't do that of course
you won... they don't have morning service that will get you there any earlier and they don't offer night service from the west coast to tokyo
but the east coast does have night service
yeah but you're flying back across the us to go to tokyo
ok and i'm speaking with
i know but i could do other business there
but you're still getting in at two in the mo... or two in the afternoon on monday you're not saving
yeah no no no i guess i don't don't need
yeah
there's nothing arriving in tokyo uh uh in the you mean two in the afternoon i would arrive
# o'clock is the earliest #:##
that's in the afternoon
right on monday
ok and that's it huh
right
b c
ok so in order to get in there on friday afternoon at # o'clock i leave here
you'd leave here thursday
thursday is what time in the
ok let me get the schedules for thursday
when would be the e... the earliest flight arriving on uh for friday so
ok the earliest if it's available would be the japan airlines let's see you want to do san francisco let me check their schedules here i'm trying to find out which arrival is the earliest because non-stop see they have connections that get you in at #:## but as far as non-stop service looks like ##:## arriving #:## is going to be the earliest on a thursday you could conceivably get in earlier if you wanted to uh leave san francisco at # a m arrive los angeles #:## and then take a japan airlines from los angeles at ## a m arriving #:## on thursday
ok so that sounds like a route that i would that i would be interested in uh
and book ahead because the th... the tokyo flights sell out weeks in advance if you can
ok can we make a reservation on that one now
which what is the departure date that you're referring to
ok you you just need a schedule you said
um i have to be there for the july #th weekend it's the last week of june last thursday of june
how about the ##th flying out on the ##th
the ##th is a wednesday
yeah but you have you said you have to arrive on a thursday
i have to arrive on a friday i have to arrive friday well this would arrive the routing that you suggested to los angeles
ok let me see cos that was on a wednesday i'm looking on a thursday ok now is this going to be business class is this a business trip
it's a business trip coach business and first
coach business and first www policy allows you to fly business on anything over # hours so you could fly business los angeles tokyo ok now on thursday to arrive on friday ok let me see cos the schedules to los angeles japan airlines doesn't service a service on thursday so it would be a korean airline ## a m arriving #:## on friday but then you... you're probably just as easy to take well it's up to you a non-stop out of san francisco departs at ## and gets in only about ## minutes later than that connection through los angeles
ok
there's there's a united
uh yes i ha... i ca... i i can't travel on saturday uh well the latest the earli... i could leave saturday night probably around midnight or ## at night
ok so it looks like you know flying direct from here if i leave on thursday uh i could do about # o'clock in the afternoon into tokyo
right exactly there's a ## noon arrives #:## it's non-stop from san francisco to tokyo
let me um just go ahead and book this united flight cos there aren't that many seats on that and what's your last name
c
and first name
b
no i i uh i just want to make the reservation to make sure i have a spot
ok and the travel advance we don't have yet either is that correct
no no i i might very well call you back in a few days and change it to make it earlier
ok so presently let me tell you what we're holding ok that's united # # # on the ##th of june departing san francisco ## noon and arriving tokyo at #:##e p m on friday the ##th and that is a non-stop flight and what is your seating preference ok ok and then you're gonna call back with the rest of the itinerary on this
ok this is to tokyo
mhm
ok
ok
anything else ok thanks
thank you
bye bye
american express travel this is a
well it's uh a regular um mileage plus upgrade where you use the miles you've accumulated so it's good for booking first class all i have to do is give you the coupon it's it's uh the number one priority type of uh
ok and is it for one way or round trip or per segment
it's round trip but if i only use it one way it doesn't matter it's a ro... round trip i mean i have to forfeit the rest of it
ok that's uh united flight ## on the ##th of june
yeah
oh wait wait wait wait you said the ##th
##th i'm sorry
i put ##th that's all right
ok let me change that
monday isn't the best time
uh a this is uh b i need to make some reservations i need to make uh reservations and all i know at this uh time is my flight out uh departing on monday what do you need first
no it isn't ok so that's united flight ## on the ##th of june
yeah
departing san francisco at #:## a m
yeah
arriving newark at #:## p m
right so uh now i'm not i'm still making uh reservations or er appointments for the rest of the week so i'll have to get back to you on the return
ok
ok
that's fine ok thanks a
thank you
ok let me let me pull up your profile first ok and the date that we know we're booking is on what day
ok
bye bye
bye
um it's monday the ##th
and that's flying to what city
uh to newark united flight number ## and i'd like first class if it's available i'm gonna use an upgrade coupon which is coming federal express tomorrow or wednesday that's the ##th i'm sorry
now that's on the ##th
yeah i'm sorry i thought monday was the ##th
ok do know wha... which award um
hi a it's b but now i'm going to talk about cd's
ok let's see well what time does he want to arrive how much earlier
about like at least by # i'm going to put you on hold for just a second while you check that out
ok sure
thanks i'm back
ok uh let's see from orlando to miami we do have a delta flight that lands at #:## it leaves orlando at #:## there's also a braniff flight at #:## departing that gets in at #:## and those are the only ones i have right up you know before # there's also earlier flights getting in a little after # #:## or #:##
ok so if we go from orlando to miami on the delta that would probably be all right
yeah that i mean we can we can go with that one if you want um let's see his i guess you've already got his tickets
have em
you should they were run on the ##st let me see when g was yeah they were run yesterday maybe she just hasn't gotten around to calling you with them but i mean that's no big deal we could always uh always change them now let's see what what the new price would be and if we would just reissue the whole ticket or just that one portion or have him revalidate it was ticketed at a fare of #### and if we go we could get it for um #### because the delta flight would price lower than the uh continental he had been booked on
ok
ok
if we just go ahead and reticket the whole thing you want to go ahead and and go with the delta flight
sure
ok it's flight # # # on tuesday the #th out at #:## from orlando and into miami at #:## and let me just make sure that i can get him his um non-smoke aisle seat on that one
ok
same deal and its a non-penalty fare of ####
thank you
aha
bye
he's leaving on # #
ok hold on a second how do you spell his last name oh ok on the #th of june flying to miami right er actually
yes
to orlando and then on to miami and then um
oh oh we need to oh yes ok that's a on... no on # # ok on # # from orlando to miami he needs so
#:##
aha so we need to take an earlier flight
a this is b i need some help trying to get from seattle to uh san francisco monday night the
from seattle let me take a look and see from portland to san francisco what the earliest flight would be and their earliest flight would have you arrive at #:## a m
shoot
no it's not not great
looks like i'm going to miss that meeting ok so the only possiblity real remote one is #:## us air flight huh
right or there was a #:## i think there's a united at #:## let me pull it back up again ok um yeah the us air's at #:## getting in at #:## or there's a united at #:##
ok
that gets in at #:##
are there seats on both of those
mhm yeah they were both available the us air's got less seats available than the united the united's wide open but the us air um is selling out in the lower classes of service so there's st... still seats available but they're not quite as many as the united flight
ok can you make me a reservation on the us air one thanks
#th
aha bye bye
bye
#th or tuesday morning the #th
ok
my problem is that my family and i are leaving san francisco on twa at # o'clock in the morning on the #th
right ok you uh spoke with me earlier
oh ok is there can you check for any flights that um leave either seattle or portland and get into san francisco by # o'clock in the morning
ok if you leave from portland the evening before meaning um monday night the getting in at #:## so it wasn't any better it was worse back
ok
good afternoon virgin trainlines sandra speaking for which journey do you wish to purchase a ticket
just for # person
and do you have a railcard at all
i have an o a p railcard
senior
a senior yeah oh yes
and what time would you like to depart
well erm i've just checked these train times and i've been given that's #:## from hertford
aha
and it it's a through train and it arrives in taunton at ##:##
ok and when do you like to return
oh good afternoon erm i'm wishing to er travel to taunton
er on friday the##th of october
departing at what time
er ##:## taunton arriving crewe ##:## and then the connection from crewe is ##:## arriving hertford ##:##
right
and the first one the the hertford to taunton i... it's a through train there's no changing on it nan it's a new one i think with the new timetable
yeah now on the return i've got the train departing at ##:## from taunton but you're changing at birmingham new street you arrive in bi...
i don't normally oh well i i don't want to change at birmingham new street
you don't want to
no
now i'll specify crewe and see what it brings up now i've got the one from taunton to crewe so i'm just going to check availability to see what's your cheapest fare i can offer you
from
rightio
now if you just like to bear with me a moment please
yeah sure
thank you for holding there i'm just actually having to double check that time on the return
oh right
now i'm just checking to see whether or not the super advance with the railcard is available
er are those train times ok then the ##:##
yeah i was just actually double checking that because all part of the journey that you're doing is actually on virgin trains but the last part from crewe to hertford is a central train it's a local connection so i'm just making sure it's going to be valid on the kind of ticket we're going to sell you so i'm just double checking
i think i think it usually is because normally i've travelled erm i i've done this before
yeah it's just that there's been new restrictions been added since the #th of september
hertford in cheshire
oh i see right
so but i've checked that out and that's ok so the fare's going to be ## pounds ##
yeah
and that's with your senior railcard discount
yes

this is a at american express can i help you
the ##nd and he needs to be there in time for an evening meeting if he can be say around # o'clock
let me see here
##nd of june did i make that clear
yeah a... i assumed that yeah eh there's nothing really that gets in that early uh air canada has a connection through toronto that leaves san francisco at #:## a m arrives toronto at #:## but the connection to ottawa doesn't leave until #:## getting into ottawa at #:## and
when
that's about the earliest one
um ok
other than leaving the evening before i mean the you know like just after midnight
so we have one tha... on air canada that goes to toronto huh
right and then it's a change of planes there but it doesn't arrive into ottawa until #:##
oh yes a this is b
let me take all that down anyway ok i guess it's too at what time does it get to toronto
eh #:## p m
mhm
and departs there at #:## do you want the flight numbers on these
right aha
uh the first one is air canada flight # # # #
mhm
the connection is flight # # #
aha and it arrives ottawa
at #:## p m
ok thanks what can i help you with
all right do you have any that get in... into uh ottawa later in the evening
eh yes one second
ge... are there any direct flights at all
eh only if there's an overnight direct flight on piedmont but it leaves leaves the night before at ##:## p m
let me see i'm writing this down that's piedmont what
eh flight # # # # it really isn't worth considering i just noticed it makes three stops
no no
i mean it's direct in that it's the same plane all the way through but it's
nan
there are no non-stop flights um
well c is going to go to ottawa
that's what i was wondering ok
there's a cp air f... uh connection through vancouver it get's in later it leaves at #:## a m and arrives vancouver at
what is cp air
it's a canadian airline like air canada it's
and it flies out of san francisco
aha
huh what's that number then
uh it's cp air flight # # #
# # #
it's out of san francisco at #:## a m
is this for a new reservation
aha
arrives vancouver at ##:## a m it connects to cp air flight # # #
mhm
that leaves vancouver at # p m and arrives ottawa at #:## p m that does make one stop between vancouver and ottawa
where does it stop
let's see looks like calgary
like calgary ok
yeah calgary
all right then coming back if if you ha... do you have a late flight out on the ##rd probably not huh
well let me see we might cos the time zone's in our v... our favor coming this direction
yes and i what i need right now are um choices
aha he said either l... late on the ##rd or or any time on the ##th
ok by late he means something like nine ten like that cos there's an # p m departure
tha... uh i think that's that's
would that be good
aha
ok there's an # p m departure on air canada it's flight # # # # it arrives into toronto at #:## connects to air canada flight # # # # that's out of toronto at ##:## p m and arrives san francisco at ##:## a m on the ##th
no i'm it leaves ottawa # # # # leaves ottawa at what time
# p m
# p m and arrives at toronto
#:##
just flight information then
#:## and leaves toronto at ##:##
right
and arrives
#:## does
mhm
and arrives san francisco at ##:## a m
ok and then what about saturday a flight next saturday
yeah one second uh there's an early air canada connection through toronto again
aha
it's uh flight # # # # out of ottawa at #:## a m arrives toronto at #:## a m
right
mhm
connects to air canada flight # # # #
mhm
out of toronto at #:## a m
mhm
and arrives san francisco at ##:## a m
all right i think tha... this is enough for him to consider for the time being and i'll get back with you
ok great
all right thank you very much
thanks a lot
ok and what date is he gonna go
bye bye
bye bye
hi mr b this is c with american express
ok and this is from san francisco
yeah
and about what time did you want to leave
uh what's your first # or # morning flights on the #th
ok there's a delta non-stop at #:## a m
mhm
that gets in at #:## the next non-stop is going to be the next non-stop is sold out
probably united
yes the one second canadian air
oh ok
yeah hi uh yes i called to make arrangements for a trip to vancouver leaving on august #th and returning on august ##th from sfo
united uh at ##:## is would stop down
n... n... that's too late
yeah
um
that delta flight looks the best
ok that's delta flight what and when again
delta flight# # # # on the #th of august out of san francisco at #:## and into uh vancouver at uh #:##
ok
and then continuing or returning on what date
uh returning the ##th
ok this is a new reservation here
returning the ##th right
let's get uh two options in here one will be coming back uh direct say leaving around uh # p m or so
mhm
and the other option will be leaving a little earlier stopping over in seattle for a few hours and then coming back down so let's just go the direct return leaving around # p m
ok the # no-stops are on canadian airlines they are at #:## p m and # p m nothing in between there
that's it
aha
ok what about a a change of planes or a quick stop-over or one stop maybe in either portland or seattle and continuing on down
ok
connecting through seattle there'd be a #:## departure uh on alaskan air um it connects up with a united flight at #:## but let me see what you'd how long do you want would you prefer in uh uh seattle
it's a new reservation
um if i stop over seattle i'll want a few hours so what i'll want to do is um probably not leave seattle until about #:## or so
would you still you would still want to leave around the # o'clock # o'clock hour
yeah
nan
ok
yeah well that's one the other thing is i'll look at uh moving that up a bit
aha second
but for the moment let's just consider that #:## alaska
ok and that then you're saying connects with a #:## united
right there's a #:## on united let me look at that instead and then expand your return ok there's um a like i could get you on a #:## united out of vancouver it's into seattle at #:##
this is a b not
mhm
uh i see a #:## p m departure on united let me see if there's something later here uh looks like we might need to get you something earlier if you want that kind of time in seattle uh #:## is the last flight out
#:## is the last anybody has out of
correct
oh i thought i'd been there later than that uh not even a one-stop or a non-stop
uh let me get you on a on a one-stop here wait even a one-stop that's that's showing to be the last flight out
that's it
aha
nan ok
right
not ok yeah i was a little confused there one second here and do you have a charge number at this time ok going up to vancouver you said on the #th of august
um ok so you said at the moment you've got a a #:## united out of vancouver #:## into seattle
aha
and i guess a couple of united connections but the latest is #:##
correct
and that get... get's back in the bay area at what time
at #:##
#:##
ok if i took what would be the normal direct connection from that #:##
the normal connection would be a #:## departure getting you back in at #:##
#:## ok why don't you go ahead and ticket me on that so i'll take that #:## united # # # and then departing again #:##
on the #th
ok we've got you then on united flight # # #  # on the ##th of august out of whoops one second one second hold on just a second i grabbed the wrong flight one second ok that's united sorry # # # #
# # # # out of vancouver
at #:##
right
into seattle at #:##
aha
connecting to united  # # # #
# # # #
leaving seattle at #:## and getting into san francisco at #:##
ok and informational purposes the last united flight and almost one of the last direct flights is #:## and what is that flight number
the #th
uh that flight number is united flight # # # #
# # # # ok so i'm up on delta as a non-stop at #:## and i'm back on united at uh #:## the next day
that's correct
ok
the fare on this is ### ##
ok uh ### ## is there any
no restrictions on it
no restrictions none ok
and i do need to advise you you do need to bring proof of u... united states citizenship
yep

hi this is a at american express may i help you
ok that's all right
well i have one fare let me give you that and i'm just trying to see if i can verify it on another carrier
ok
uh one way fare would be ####
w... round trip
the round trip would be that times # plus ## for taxes
ok
uh it looks like approximately right uh using twa instead of american i get #### a little bit higher
ok
so it's it's in that ballpark
hi a this is b physical sciences business office at uh www
ok ## ## times # plus ##
there isn't any one carrier that flies all the way in there you need to connect somewhere like from twa to air france or pan am to air france or something to get in to baron
aha
and also you can't get business class all the way through but they fare it business class all the way
ok
you you you would get business class from the us to your european gateway city and then for the little hop to baron you would probably be in coach
yeah ok
ok
that helps
ok great
yeah and uh what can i help you with
thanks a lot
you're welcome bye bye

now do you hold a current credit or debit card
mhm
and that the ## pounds ## each
yeah
now the only train that i can get availability on is the ##:## changing at bla... sorry changing at preston and you arrive in blackpool north for ##:##
and that's the only available one there
yeah
so are there no trains that go directly to blackpool you always have to change
the direct services are all booked up i've checked them first of all
fully booked right yeah no i just wondered if you if they went direct erm oh dear so well i don't know what to do i'll have to check with my husband i think i'm going to call back later and just take a chance
right well you the super advance return you must book by # o'clock the day before travel
yes i do
yeah ok
and that's subject to availability
yeah
but
nan
aha
cos what's the other one the other one we got before was it a twin a value twin or something they're all gone as well i suppose
er it was the probably a twosome if it was two people
twosome yeah
the twoso... the twosome is no longer an available ticket
and how many people's travelling
oh isn't it
it's a virgin groupie and it has to be # or # people travelling
right ok
so if every super advance return is booked up by the time you call back then travelling on the friday it's going to cost you ## pounds each
right can you just give me a price if there's er # of us travelling cos i mean i might have to end up booking the other people's tickets as well so
right if you just bear with me i'll just check availability now do you want to start on the friday again
yeah please
unfortunately that ticket's fully booked up as well it is ## pounds but there's none available for the dates and times on the ##th or the ##th
oh ok then alright i i'll have to take a chance and call back later and see if i can get the other one
ok then
#
alright thanks for your help
thanks for calling bye
and does anyone have a railcard
no
now what date would you like to depart from london
hello
oh yeah
ok
yeah it applies to any type of fare
ok well thanks for that information i don't think it costs more than i thought but the guy i'm going with will be flying business and i'll be sitting in the back of the plane
yeah there you go ok
th... thanks for your help
sure bye bye
bye bye
hi this is a with american express travel
yes i spoke to you about ## minutes ago about uh japan around the world
oh right
can you tell me what it costs for business class fo... for uh round trip japan versus business class uh
ok i don't know if they offer i don't think they offer a business uh class around the world it has to be economy ok i found out um restrictions also as far as you're inquiring about penalties and stuff
ok
um ok san francisco tokyo uh fare quote for business round trip would be #### and again the coach was #### and then for the #### that was economy but there it is also offered for business and first class the business around the world fare would be #### and first class #### and that's again the same of of applications of four stop overs uh for minimum maximum of ## and the purchase restrictions were ## days in advance cancellation within uh or longer then ## days prior to the departure you get a full refund within ## days of the flight it's ## percent penalty um attached to all all of those fares economy business and first and if um bu... in case of illness or death or anything like that it is uh waivable the ## percent
but that even applies to these apex and stuff
i wanted to uh um get a flight um to los angeles and back uh leaving on friday uh
from san francisco or san jose
um whichever's cheaper and i wanted to return on monday july ##st
a... a... when afternoon er
uh actually nan uh yeah um evening would be fine
ok i think i'm going to check the fare should be the same out of either airport let me just check here ok it's it's going to be the same airfare out out of ei... either airport
ok
it's ## round trip
it's going to be ## for round trip
## round trip on a non-refundable non-changeable ticket
uh would it have been cheaper if i had called a couple weeks in advance
ok who am i speaking with
uh ## days in advance there are lower fares into los angeles
and how much is that
uh let me check here those are ## round trip
mhm ok um well um i guess ##'s ok then uh would the price have gone up if i had called just a couple days in advance
yes
ok
airfare you have to have at least a # day advance purchase and that's today's the last day to buy it for the ##th and it would have gone up to # ## and then it would have gone up to uh # ## one way well they have a ## one way and then a ### one way
ouch
so it jumps up pretty high
yeah ok um well that would be fine then um see the time on friday that i'd like to depart would be evening um preferably around # o'clock
uh this is a b
if you could leave at like # in the morning i could get you a low airfare they only have one flight a day
oh really
now let me just let me check their times and i'll tell you what now going out isn't bad it's coming back that's bad ok they have fare of ## round trip
really
going out it's a # p m arriving ##:## p m coming back it's #:## in the morning getting in at #:## in the morning
that's fine
you want to do that
for ## dollars
## dollars non-refundable non-changeable today's the deadline for for buying that ticket
ok now you were saying that it leaves on friday when
ok all right i'm sorry your last name is
ok friday it's a # p m arriving ##:##
ok that
and coming back it's a #:## in the morning
#:## on tuesday morning
yeah uh let me see the table on tuesday hold on for the #st of august ok it is available on tuesday morning at #:## in the morning getting into san francisco at #:## in the morning
ok
you want to book that
yeah that sounds just perfect actually um so the departure time is # o'clock on friday
yes
is that is that the only departure time
uh b nan
they only have one flight a day that's it that's all they have
ok
ok that's why their fare is lower then everyone else's they only have they don't have any competition they have one flight um it's continental # # # on the ##th of july departing san francisco # p m arriving los angeles ##:## p m continental # # # on the #st of august tuesday departing los angeles #:## a m arriving san franciscso #:## a m
#:## ok
aha
is this going to be put on a credit card ok so this ticket is non-refundable non-changeable and today is the deadline for ticketing ok
that sounds good
all right
thanks
thanks for calling bye bye
ok and is this a business trip we're doing
bye
no this is personal
mhm ok and the date you wanted to go to los angeles is
uh friday july ##th
i have a travel for uh scheduled leaving leaving on monday
uh it leaves #:## to dallas #:## from denver yeah flight # ## dallas to denver leaving at #:## arriving #
yeah
and then united flight # ## denver to san francisco leaving at #:## and arriving el... ##:##
correct uh now that we've got all that and just trying to think it would be wh... what happens to the cost if i change and leave from oakland
it would have to be on am... on united
uh i prefer that
ok let me i'll do it that way
uh looks like oakland doesn't fly that way it looks like it would be slightly cheaper out of oakland but you would have to connect going to dallas there's no non-stops
mhm
uh there's a #:## connection through denver that gets into dallas at like #:## around #:## in the evening coming back you could take the same #:## flight it just connects to another flight to oakland rather then to san francisco it's at #:##
aha
yeah what i really need to do is check with my wife to see if she can pick me up uh let's uh aha l... l... let's book it through uh san francisco and if if i need to change i'll get back to you as soon as i can
ok otherwise do you want me to set up for a new ticket to be run for you because you sh... should have a new ticket
and will you cancel the then both the flight to chicago and the flight from chicago
i already have and everything in chicago
ok i i had what's what's the total cost on that then
# ## out of sa... san francisco # ## out of oakland
ok and is it less be... on on the way back because of the stop
uh i don't believe so i think it's just different fares you know oakland has slightly different fares to dallas than y... yeah it turns out there's an earlier united flight a #:## it leaves at #:## flight # # #
coming back you mean
yeah
to dallas and i need to make a change
although that stops someplace too doesn't it
let me check # # # that is a one-stop flight yes
yes
see where it stops it stops in denver
denver
and arrives at #:## and departs again at #:## so a little over an hour
i don't think i can make it to that one so let's let's leave it the way we have it and and and i will call back to confirm
ok right i won't ticket without your approval on it
ok
ok
ok sure let me pull it up here ok i've got it
thank you very much a
thank you
bye bye
bye
uh ok turns out i will be coming back to san francisco as opposed to going to chicago
ok
so
on wednesday then correct the ##th and there's a united flight # # # dallas to denver and then connecting to san francisco flight # # #
when does that leave
good morning american express this is a
i see you think that's that's all it takes
ok and let's see that's delta flight ## ##
## ##
leaving at #:## arrival boston #:##
##:##
right
thank you
aha
bye
bye
that is that should be all it takes because they are uh they honor it for all www employees normally a lot of people ask us for government rates at specific hotels or airlines or and you have to have some type of government badge or government id
yes
but with holiday inns www's got a negotiated rate all you really need to show
oh that's fine
ok
that's fine now tell me this i mean i you know i got a confirmation number from them i i i live in london england
mhm
in the in the in the www office there um i'd quite like to get something in in writing how do we do that
ok let's see um if it's you made it directly with them
good morning a i i'm with www
yes
mhm
i mean if i gave you the confirmation number could you could you just uh get sort of a i mean type out a
yeah i could print up an order for them d and then send me a copy
i could what i could do is s... sell it as a book direct segment and i could print out an itinerary for you
yes
and that would have the the address and phone number and all that kind of stuff about the hotel plus the confirmation number
i i'd appreciate that yeah
sure and what's um what's the confirmation number first of all
it's
mhm
nan ok and um that was the holiday inn in palo alto
no it was the holiday inn in boston
oh ok little bit far away there
that's the boston government center it's called
ok let me pull up their um which one ok i've got that um got that listing and
um
i'll send that address in that's the one on blossom street
ok
# blossom and what is your last name
ccc
and um i've i've made a couple of bookings um with holiday inn on the on the on the free phone line
aha nan
ok
first name ddd
all righty
and do you want to know the the days of the booking or don't you need that
uh actually yes i would need to know the date you're checking in and the date you're checking out
uh well i'm checking in on the ##st of july late
ok
and checking out #st of august
#st of august
aha
and it's uh it's a room with # beds actually
ok
one child
all right um
that's it they told me ## dollars plus tax
## plus tax
ok and and then there's some some more coming up
ok
on the #th and #th of august nights of #th and #th of august in new york and it's the north burigan new jersey hotel
ok let me pull up their and is that a a holiday inn also
um i just wondered they said to me you know we're government contractor and you made the reservation for me for for the last week um
yes
ok let me pull up the
they call it north burigan
address on that one hmm north let's see ok that was um i think it's called the holiday inn lincoln tunnel if i'm not mistaken in north burigan and that's on um canal avenue let's see let's put that one i'm just jotting this down for further reference ok and that was for checking in on the #th but checking out on the ##th morning of the ##th
no on the #th
ok so just for the # night
no it's for # nights
for # nights
i'm i'm
oh that's correct uh #th and #th
aha
checking in on the #th and staying the night of the #th and checking out on the #th
ok
and that was ## dollars plus tax and there i only need a double room
and did you already make that reservation
yes i made that
and the confirmation number for that
it's the same number ok ok and
and what are you doing are you actually checking that again are you just sending me
i was just going to send you an itinerary with the
ok
at at the palo alto holiday inn what what signal do i have to give the holiday inn people to what proof that i'm you know that i'm with www and i'm i'm a gov government on this government thing they said bring some sort of government number
and then what about at www whose extension should i have them call to um come pick up the itinerary
oh do is is that what they normally do
yeah normally we've got a an office over at www that we generate all our tickets and itineraries through and then the person our employee there will call call you and and just tell you that it's ready to come down and and pick it up
oh i see ok um let me see cos i'm i'm only visiting here um
is there someone that we you're visiting
i'll give you call extension
ok
mrs gg
nan all righty we'll um have them call her when the itinerary is all ready to be picked up
ok now i had an... one other question
i think as long as you've got your www id that's enough
mhm
um about delta airline's flights
mm okay
um can you just tell me um there's a flight on on a tuesday in august #st of august uh boston to nantucket um there's a #:## flight um can you tell me when that arrives in uh and what the flight number is
sure let me pull it up here #:## a m
yes
delta flight ## ##
delta ## ## ## ## ##
it leaves at #:## out of boston arrival in nantucket is at ##:## a m
##:## a m ok and then there's the flight from nantucket back to boston on friday uh leaving at ##:## if you could give me the same details about that flight number and uh
hi i'd like to make a couple of arrangements
yeah great
so all i needed was the travel advance for him
ok the travel advance is
ok and do you want me to read off the flights
yes would you please
that uh we've gone through sure on the ##th of july it's american flight # # #  # leaving san jose at # a m
mhm
arrival into lax at #:##
mhm
and then returning that same day on american flight # # # #
ok is it for domestic or international
mhm
and that's departing at # p m from la arrival san jose at #:##
ok
and they were confirmed at a fare of # ## there were no penalties attached to that fare
mhm
and the only thing that uh was a stumbling block in the reservations was the return seat on american flight # # # we could only get middle seating for all # passengers
oh
and i advised mr fff of that and he said they would um look into it when they check in in san jose nan
yeah that's a good idea to do that
ok
uh domestic
ok so this will be exactly the duplicate for mr hhh except that his um advance number is
nan
ok
thank you very much a
sure bbb no problem
ok dear bye bye
bye
ok bbb
ok who's the traveller then the first one
uh the traveller will be ccc ddd

it sure is
ok i've already made it with um eee fff he called up
taping our conversation if that's ok with you
ok on the ##th we can put him on us air # # # #
aha
and then on the return still on the ##th
ok i he wants this changed also
what time um to #:##
#:## ok ok us air flight # # or excuse me # # # # now let me just confirm that and give you the round trip fare
ok
ok ## dollars would be the lowest confirm... confirmable fare and that is a non-penalty fare as well looks like bbb had set these up to be issued on the #th of july that's today is that still ok with you to have them
fine i'm supposed to get an aisle seat for him for both flights
sure let's take a look ok i'm requesting # c on the outbound flight and then on his return well let's try like only thing available would be fifteen c on the return flight those are both aisles that's non-smoking and that's non-smoking yeah and within california it's going to be non-smoking
fine
ok
what about does he have a us air frequent flyer number because we do not have one in his profile
nan
ok good all righty now then we're not missing that in the profile at least and we'll get him his car is uh confirmed for intermediate car in san diego
that's fine
and no hotel right
ok aha
ok thanks a lot
thank you

american express a speaking
bye
bye
hi a b c again
hi mr c
i uh wanted to check to see if it was possible to reput me back on that # # # flight
uh one second here i'm showing that flight as being sold out completely
sold out completely ok well keep me where i am then
all righty
ok thanks
sure thing
american express this is a
ok let me get a generic profile one moment
so when you request them you don't get responses at all on them for days
so like we won't know if it's how about non-smoking and window aisle and all that stuff
yeah i'm i'm going to do that but i just what i have to do is like a generic request instead of asking for specific seats
i see
yeah i can see what seats are available but then they don't tell us which ones we can't some of them are blo... blacked out for restrictions or like and we can't really tell on those on their seats maps are really i know that they said it's a real problem for themselves even their own agents trying to do their own seat assignments ok let me just see here that's us air # # # #
departing at
# a m on the ##th arriving #:## and the return would be i believe us air # # # # departing at # o'clock p m
ok what d... is that on the same day
same day ok you said # p m
mhm ok that'd be us air # # # # on the on the ##th
nan
oh
they've changed their flight number oh wait hold on a second th... that's wrong hold on a moment my computer here it's acting very strange ok so that's us air # # # # on the ##th departing los angeles # p m arriving san francisco #:## p m are we booking can i put you on hold for a moment
sure
thanks
ok did we are we booking a car b
yes
under which name
g
and do you know what size he uh what his profile if his profile says it's what's in his profile should we do that
yeah uh mi... uh midsized mhm that's on the profile
that's
yeah
ok
well from what these travellers are telling me there's only like a dollar difference between compact and midsized
oh ok
so i guess that's why they they all right so the airfare again like i said is um ### total now that's ## a person
pardon me
## a person
it's # ## each way on the airline
oh i see # ## per person
# ## per person
that's correct
all right
and i guess
i'm sorry
i gotta offer what the lowest fares are so i have to see what the lowest fares returning are too ok so the lowest airfare being declined is ## each way on pan am but leaving at # in the morning and
right and coming back when
coming back they have a # p m arriving #:##
which again is too early too bad they didn't just schedule it an hour different maybe that's why it's so cheap
mhm right so we just have we do we just have to offer it and notate that it was declined ok so # ## will be what's declined # ## is what's being paid and the other passenger wants what kind of seating
oh h f
yeah nan
first name h
he would like a non-smoking window
ok and these tickets will be sent over today is there anything else
yes um i need u... wh... let's see we've gotten the car in uh in at lax from wh... wh... what rental agency
that's hertz hertz midsized
hertz midsized in j's name and um i need one more thing um h f does not drive and needs uh some kind of arrangement from his home to the airport so i believe there's a limo that goes directly by www and he's only about a block from there from here
ok there's there's the www the um airport connection has a ## dollar it's ## dollars and they have a pickup right at www
ok
if he takes a limousine it's ## each way
aha
to take a limousine so does he want the airport connection that just picks up right at www
right
y... yeah i think i'll go ahead and commit him to that
ok
i don't think he wanted to to spend ## each way to be committed to it but do you know this area
aha
or are you not in on this site
no i'm not there but um if he walks or what
well how far where's he at
i'm just wondering how far he really is from c... from our site
i know where you're at but w... do you know where he's at
he's at the
ok his id number is nan
ok i know where
is it
i'm trying to think nan he's in palo alto
no menlo park
oh i didn't know that went down to menlo park
yeah i think he really is pretty close but uh i am committing him to making it into www by like # in the morning or something what time is the pickup
um they are ## minutes to the hour so it would have to be #:## no it can't be #:## it'd have to be like #:## they might have a six let me see #:## i think they have like a #:## that would get him there like a quarter to # but i don't know if that's like going to be enough time to check in
well he won't have any luggage a quarter to # is a little close
ok let me let me call and i'll put him on the best one we can
yeah that
and the charge number
and see exactly what their times are
yeah that may not be appropriate i don't want him to both have to walk all walk over to www and if the timing works for that then i think that'd be appropriate otherwise i think we should get the limo
ok you mean at #:## if they have one at #:## he'll take that one see the... they're not going to be at #:## cos it takes them about a half hour to get to the airport he wouldn't make his flight
aha # let's see
it's probably i think it's like ## to si... ## to # or then i think they then have another one at i'm not sure if they're just ## minutes to the hour it would be ## to # and that would
nan cos i'm not a traveller and i there but um what time do you think he should arrive at the airport if he has no luggage and wants to get on the # o'clock flight
well if he he he should at least arrive ## minutes before the flight if not they can sell his seat to someone else
oh
so that's the problem
ok so he should he should be leaving here at # o'clock then it seems like
charge number is
# he he would get there about #:## right so they leave
nan
## to #
yeah if he's disembarking from the van at at #:## then he's
yeah
probably ## till so  e... even the limousine if he takes the limousine a shared ride limousine for ## dollars they're going to pick him up an hour and a half prior to departure cos he's not going to be the only person in that limousine the... they're going to go around and make pick ups
aha
and then they're they're probably going to say #:## they're going to pick him up
ok if it if it if it comes if there is one you are you saying there definitely is one at ## to #
there is one definitly ## to # i'm not certain whether they have them like after ## minutes after the hour i know they have them ## minutes to the hour
and the travel advance number
ok well i think the ## to # would be the most appropriate one
ok and does he is that round trip or just the one way
that is round trip
ok ok i i'll go ahead and book that then that'll also be printed on his itinerary his pick up time
um ok and how about exact location of pickup where does he need to be
i think building a let me find out ok
ok
ok it's building a is where they pick up
at the front steps
right
hi a this is c d i'd like to make some reservations please
well i have two of them one for j which is
and what's the name of the company
it's airport connection
airport connection
aha
all right
ok
that's it thank you very much
thanks bye
bye bye
ok wait i need h first
h
yeah nan
nan
and j g's is
ok i don't need his yet
ok
i can only do one th... one profile at a time
i see
no problem
we do a generic profile and i have to implement all this first then i can go into another area and do the other person ok
will you be using this information to start a a profile for h f
no the only way we'll start a permanent profile a form has to be filled out and completed by him and signed
ok well
and that'll come back to us and then it's put in the computer
would you like to send it to me at e
um they have'em at the travel office
ok
the forms
ok
what's the last name of the passenger
because everything on this once he departs will completely leave our computer
all right
and your ex... extension at www
nan
nan ok ok let me we have a profile for g yes we do ok let me get his profile for j g
ok
all right and the same charge number for him
yes
ok now his travel advance is ok and they're travelling to what city
i'm sorry
speech lab do they care how we how we talk
what city are they travelling to
to la
on what date
on tuesday i'm sorry on monday the ##th
is that from san francisco or san jose
well i don't know that there is anything available the ideal would be from uh san jose to uh long beach but i have a feeling that fli... a flight won't be available direct
a... a... and this is for the morning
yeah
well there's a united at #:## arriving long beach at ##:##
too too late uh it'd have to be at # o'clock
i don't know um what what's the last name of the passenger
ok that would be san francisco
or #:## at the latest yeah if it can't be san j... can it be san francisco long beach
no it can't either ok they the service out of san francisco is #:## is the first flight out
sfo to lax then
ok i can get them san jose lax at # is is san jose closer to them er
mhm
or should we just do san francisco
that's hard to say maybe sfo's fine i have a feeling we're in menlo park so
oh ok
and i think they each live fairly close to here so probably sfo is better actually
um i've two passengers f
ok there is a united us air or american at #
ok i think we had better price rates on the us air didn't we or was it
pardon me
are the rates better on the us air
um they're going to be exactly the same i'm going to offer you what the lowest fare is it's not going to be on either of those carriers
oh
the lowest airfare would be on pan am at # a m arriving #:## their airfare is ## dollars everyone else is ## dollars
departing at # a m huh
yeah # a m
that's that's a little cruel
what's the first name on f h f  and j g ok i don't have a profile for f
pardon me
that's a little cruel they they have to be in la at #:## and so um i think we'll stick with us air number i think # # # # it goes down
do you want to do does it matter to them do you know
what
uh carrier
no
can we put them on american
why
only because we're having a lot of seat problems i... if i'm going to try and get them seats together
aha
i have that information here
we're having a lot of problems on the us air seat maps so i i'm probably not going to be able to i don't know if i can get them together because we we request through our computer specific seats but we're not always getting them but either united or american level you know whatever we request pretty much we get i mean it's up to you i i'll just you know book the us air but the... i don't think i'll get to seat them together on that
i don't know if they care if they sit together
ok
oh i feel like flipping a coin now it's real frustrating he was i was he the us air flight was recommended by the manager i don't know if that makes he travels a lot he may of said it because of some preference i think they give really good service it's just that
pardon me
they give really good service
us air
yeah well let's go ahead and stick with it
nan they're just i mean they have seats that we you know we can't book the the way you look when you look at your map you have no idea what they are
oh
good afternoon american express this is a
okay so i... if somebody was in some other city and wanted to go to moscow there has to be other options doesn't there
oh i see what you mean departing from a different city rather than hong kong
yeah
oh sure
sa... i... t... helsinki and also there has to be some other airlines too uh that are flying into moscow besides you only gave me british airways
well well because of the connections see from hong kong to moscow there are other what i ok this is
you you what you did was you gave me you gave me the best situation
right and for the entire day for i picked on th... on the ##th of june um th... the entire day we've got the first thing that that comes up is that #:## pm flight otherwise
are we saying that maybe uh that something was filled i mean there is another option that we wouldn't be aware of
no no
a uh this is b again and i talked to c um he made me feel like there had to be some other options besides going through heathrow
oh ok
if it was sold out it would show it to me
ok that's what i was wondering
ok yeah so um the only other option i have would be a cathay pacific flight departing at hong kong at ##:## p m it arrives into london to gatwick airport at # at #:## #:## excuse me a m and then he'd connect to a british air flight out of london heathrow airport and into th... moscow so he'd be going into gatwick and leaving out of heathrow meaning he'd have to get between the two
yes i know i i indicated i said the only thing that was given to me was a flight that goes into he... you know was flights going into heathrow
right
he says well try helsinki try beijing you know there has to be some other options to getting into moscow so
ok
i i don't know and al... also he said there has to be other airlines and i he mentioned a couple i i remembered a couple aer... is it aeroflight
okay let's see
and singapore do... does singapore has a airline
see see this is what when i ask for for hong kong thi... that's what i'm trying to explain we could try building our own connection but
yeah
when i ask hong kong soviet union that's what it's giving me
yeah that's right now
yeah
uh perhaps we can build our own like you say
yeah that's maybe that's what he's talking about or depart from a different city if he wants to go for like a three point connection i mean there are three point connections available
ok he
such as
just wants me to get all the options down for him
ok
so he can make a decision
ok again asking for hong kong to uh there's a flight
let's let's go to another city first maybe that's what he's trying to say un... unless you can find a three point by going to moscow
yeah i can
ok
from hong kong which is eh what i'm saying is that uh that's the next availability that's coming up and that would be a flight that leaves at # p m from hong kong and goes on to bangkok and then he would take another flight to heathrow and then another ho... flight from heathrow to moscow
ok i've got that down as an option ok
ok otherwise there's um more through bangkok there's different carriers bangkok to heathrow to moscow as to other carriers aside from that there's one hong kong to tokyo to london to moscow everything's going to end up london moscow it's just a matter of
ok uh
ok let's try the suggestion about going to helsinki
you mean departing from helsinki to uh or hong kong helsinki
nan oh i see you always have to go you can't go straight through hong kong to
to then go through helsinki then that would we'd have to build our own connection
ok
that would be where we'd have to ask for we would force that's called forcing a connection i can ask for um flights through helsinki now see it's not going to come out let me see ##
ok let me call you back
ok cos that's it's
ok
doesn't look like its going
there had to be several different cities you can go through like beijing to helsinki there has to be some other options
ok that's what i need to find out thank you
aha
um ok well on what i do is i ask for connections er flights from hong kong to moscow and that's what it's giving me as available connections
ok
it's giving me all the legal connections available and that's what i'm getting is through heathrow

this is b
he wants to fl... he wants to fly from boston
mhm
to baltimore washington international on flight i'm sure it's piedmont p l p i
p i at what time
uh #:## p m
and this is on the ##st of june
yeah arriving  #:## p m
ok that's piedmont # # # # on the ## of june
right
departing boston #:## p m arriving baltimore #:## p m
hi b this is a from american express
right and then he wants to return from um baltimore washington and he requests flight # # # twa actually it's two flight numbers it's # # # and then it changes to # # # at #:## in the afternoon
ok one moment this is to san jose did you say
i understand it's to san francisco twa flight # # # slash # # #
# # # and # # # ok and then does he know there is a non-stop that goes from dulles to san francisco instead of connection through st louis
i think he's aware of it but i think we picked this one because um he could get the business traveller uh seating
he can also he can also get that on the non-stop
on the non-stop and what is the uh give me the times for the non-stop
ok one moment the non-stop is at #:## arriving #:##
se... #:## to #:##
into san francisco it's a non-stop from dulles to san francisco maybe he can't leave that early
oh hi
i don't know uh let me can i make the reservation and and change it by tomorrow
sure if it's it's still available right
yeah i know subject to availability i'm sorry i've been giving you quick numbers here
it's ok
it's all right let me just check the um
and now lets see what kind of fares they have a three day advance purchase fare using the business class upgrade of # # # one way
i was quoted # # # ## for the whole round f... from boston to washington from washington um to san francisco
now this portion was for baltimore san francisco only ok let me just see what
could you find out how much the fare is all total
ok it's # # # ## that has to be ticketed by the ##th of june there are no cancellation or change penalties if any changes are made it's just subject to whatever the new fare is
ok
sure
ok it has to be ticketed by the##th of june
all right
there are no penalties for cancellation if changes are made it's subject to whatever the new fares are at that time
ok
cos they're going to increase the fare
but there's no penalty existing
there's no penalty uh if it's cancelled no
yeah the non-stop flight seems to be more appealing to me i mean this man travels so much though let me check with him um
ok so what so we're going to hold we'll just go ahead and hold the um
we need to get a ticket for him from boston
hold that twa then i will inform him of the dulles flight at fou... #:## leaving uh dulles and arriving is it san francisco at #:##
it's san francisco
san francisco that's what he wants ok
it's still #:## any which way we do this i'm just thinking the convenience of the traveller
on the non-stop let me see i think you get that same fare let me check the fares
ok
i think it that would have to be using a ## percent penalty on twa yeah it would be ## dollars more if he wanted to have a fare without a penalty
mhm
because the dulles non-stop to get that ### you have to take a ## percent penalty fare if you don't then it's ### so it would increase that total fare by ## dollars
so it's ### plus ##
this is a new reservation
right if he wanted to go without a penalty it's # plus ##
he needs the cheapest rate possible on this one um so let me talk it over with him uh
okay then on the business class that would be row nine seat number five which is an aisle seat now what what about how's he getting to boston
he's already purchased his ticket
ok so this is just all one way travel
one way travel right
ok so that was available and i requested that b anything else i can help you with
i'll call you back on the dulles non-stop flight so we'll
if if he needs that right
if he needs that and if he does get that he has to pay uh ## dollars more
new reservation on june ##
if he wants to take a fare without a penalty right
a fare without a penalty
if he's willing to take it with a penalty it would be exactly the same fare
ok
ok now
i i hesitate uh for him particularly to get anything uh because he does change a lot
aha
so i i'd rather get the ## dollars but we'll see what he says
ok
thank you
ok let me let me pull up his profile first
all right thanks b
you are a right
yeah i'm a
bye bye
bye
ok and he is um
this is b
no ha ha ha ha i should have bet you we'll be going to denver colorado this time
ok and does he want to fly continental or united
united
and when about what time does he want to leave
um after work on that day so hmm we're talking ##:## or ##
ok we can get him that #... ##:## rather
##:##
and continuing or returning when
um um he'll come back on the #rd
and again late afternoon
hi b how you doing hi ok um i have two reservations to make
uh no this time around #### or ####
uh i can get her get him on a ##:## flight
hey
on united other than that it's continental at ## hundred
no united's fine
ok ok we've got him on united flight # # # on the #nd of august leaving san francisco at what is that ##:## getting into denver at
nan
##:## can you hold on one sec
yeah
thanks they hung up they don't want to talk to me
ok this is for mr c
uh
um leaving at # ##:## right not yeah yeah right it goes that way ##:##
arriving when
at ##:##
##:##
and returning on the #rd of august united flight # # #
mhm
out of denver at ##:## and into san francisco at ##:##
okey dokey
and let's check the seats
one of them is yeah
uh the other person is it going to be the same itinerary
yep
ok uh what's the next name nan
ok i will call you back with the charge number
ok
bye bye
mhm bye
let's take him first cos i like him
oh well good i'm glad
ok and what date does he want to travel
the #nd of august
out of san francisco let me guess he's going to washington
i would like to get uh some fare information
ok
we're basically the issue is that uh the client's asking us to travel on our own time on weekends
mhm
um you know to fly to sweden and back
oh
and we're thinking about whether we should ask them to pay for first class travel
eh i see ok yeah yeah make 'em pay no let's see we've got well it depends on what eh if you want to look at like j... a coach fare on a round trip basis
well it's not well we're not even considering coach
oh you just want first class
business class is a minimum
oh ok so what what type of fare do you want to go or know about
ok ok let's take a look um we're going ok business round trip would be ####
aha
and then first class round trip is gonna be ####
####
right and then i don't know if you even want to hear the coach round trip is #### as well so its the same for business or coach
coach and business class are the same
aha
really
yeah unrestricted coach that is
aha that's interesting
ok ok this is um a round trip from san francisco to stockholm
yeah
ok that's all i needed to know thanks
ok aha bye
bye
ok
and basically what i want to know is the what the business class and the first class fares are
ok all right let's take a look here uh will there be any particular date that you're be looking into
eh it would probably be uh leaving on june ##th and flying back uh the following saturday
ok and what about any particular carrier that you're looking into
eh no i have i have eh no preference
hi a this is b over in dr c's office
again this is provided that the flights are available
ok
when he calls to make the reservation um we can get him on a non-refundable fare for you know a fairly good price compared to ####
ok
#### is completely non-penalty and that is the lowest no-penalty available in that market oh it's non-penalty and the non-refundable is uh ## days prior to departure and provided that the flights are available available right and it's um that can be as low as um ### and also ### there's one it depends on what you know day of the week we're looking at if he's gonna travel on a saturday ### would apply if he were travelling midweek still staying over a saturday night there's the ### fare then the fare could range anywhere even higher than that ### for a ## percent penalty fare travelling mid-week
aha
also staying over a saturday night that's based on a # day advanced purchase or ### round trip also ## percent penalty also # day advanced purchase with a saturday night stay over but travelling on weekend days and that would be pretty much the uh the breakdown ok the ### is the highest for the for the discounted the highest for the lowest
right right
and then it would jump from there to the full coach non-penalty for ####
ok
aha
ok
so i could tell him a ra... p... pretty much a range between # ## to # ## depending on the discount
right and the time of uh when he places and time of booking and yeah the actual reservation
right
ok but if he wants to go with the lowest no-penalty coach he's gotta pay
the full coach yeah they don't offer unfortunately any discounts without penalties for that market
ok
ok
i'll let him know that
all righty sure
and we need to get an estimate on how much uh for a round trip ticket to little rock arkansas
thanks a
aha bye bye
bye bye
ok uh is there any particular date that you're looking for
uh he would like to leave um possibly the afternoon of the ##th of october
ok so let's take a look here basic fare quote um prices can range anywhere from a full coach fare of what #### round trip it all depends on what's available at the time of his booking and if he's going to be staying over a saturday night and if he's going to purchase the tickets at least ## days prior to his departure and willing to take a penalty fare
ok he will be leaving uh returning actually on the the thursday after
ok so let me take a look here oh so he would be staying over a saturday night if he's leaving on the ##th that is a saturday that would qualify him as long as he purchased the tickets ## days prior to that departure date so he would have to um have reservations made and ticketed by the ##th of uh october
aha
american express may i help you
ok
yeah we should be able to do it
um one sec let me just what's his last name
um c
first name
d
ok what flights do you want to have him on
ok he would like to be on united flight # # # #
first of all he's going all the way through to copenhagen
oh that's right aha
oh a this is b
and this is a connection in what city
eh los angeles
ok
oh and yeah
and what time does that united flight leave
it's eh going out at uh # o'clock today sfo to los angeles
and then connecting to sas flight # # # #
# # # # that's right
and you said well actually the # # # # i'm showing sold out let me just look in their system
oh no
ok wh... how can i help you
well we can put him there are other flights oh there i can get a seat on it
oh ok
nan but i can get it now is he going business class on the sas flight
um if he can go business class sure
they're allowed it for flights over ## hours
certainly oh ok great that's fine
and this is just going to be one way only right
that's correct
ok b so i have him on united flight # # # # on today friday the ##th out of san francisco at # p m
right
we have an emergency traveller who is going t... uh copenhagen from san francisco to los angeles and he is going on a # o'clock flight
arriving lax at #:## p m
aha
connecting to sas flight # # # #
right
out of lax at #:## p m it arrives copenhagen at #:## p m on the ##th of may
yes that's wonderf...
that's on request and that's already confirmed so that's great
that's just absolutely marvelous and i am wondering now if we can we add another leg to that uh
what do you want to do
um we would like on monday which would be uh let's see the ##th the holiday
he's going to copenhagen today
mhm
may ##th from copenhagen to uh sandestrom
ok
and that would be uh sas flight # # # and that is a ##:## a m departure
ok no this adds a fare that isn't in my system
oh
so if we do that i'm going to have to send it off to the airlines for faring and i can't guarantee how fast they'll come back with a fare
y... exactly yes i understand ok that's great and you did make the reservation for the uh monday # # # # flight was that possible to go on flight # # #  from copenhagen
yeah i haven't confirmed it yet but i've just got it one second
sure
that's correct yes
yes b that's that's confirmed now

so we'll just ticket as far as copenhagen and he'll deal with the rest in denmark then
uh
is that what you want to do
all right
you know if it's not back within an hour we'll just ticket him as far as copenhagen
good

bye bye
bye now
my name is b c and i would like to plan a trip
where are you going from chicago to where
greenbay so the first i need to catch the first flight from ord out to greenbay wisconsin uh monday morning
it looks like the first one is a #:## on american uh eagle that arrives greenbay at #:##
is that booked
i do show space avaliable
ok
uh let's see what would get you there then leaving probabl... the #th from san jose or san francisco
san francisco actually oakland would be good too on that
i don't know if there are any red eyes from there let's see
ok
and the date you need to leave
there is one on united that leaves oakland at ##:## p m and arrives chicago #:## a m
so that's a two-hour hold there ok any others
uh not from oakland departing from san francisco it's about the same actually american has an ##:## flight from san francisco that arrives chicago #:## and
that's and hour and a half so that's that's a a wash
yeah or wait just one moment or united has a ## #
oh that sounds good
it's about the same i don't know if you prefer united over american or
i'm a member of the united travel so let's book that midnight red eye out of sfo
aha
right will leave sfo at
well um i have to work a little bit backwards here
i'm sorry just one moment ok put this in the correct order so you'd be on united flight # # # #
united # # # #
leaving on the eighth from san francisco ## # is that right arriving chicago #:## and then you would connect with american flight # # # # leaving chicago #:## a m and arriving greenbay #:##
#:## to #:## ok and
that's actually operated by american eagle
uh what's the name of that the flight number
# # # #
# # # # ok
all righty and from there
mhm and i need a flight uh let's see i guess mid to late morning back uh
ok
from greenbay to
springfield that's that's probably going to be via chicago
let's take a look and see what we have ok united has a #:## connection through chicago and you would conn... connect with an american flight that would arrive springfield ##:##
ok
or you can take american both legs leaving at #:## and connecting with the same flight
all right so let's see it's only #:## to ##:## for that trip
mhm
that sounds good to me
let me give you those flight numbers
ok
i want to leave on the first flight out of ord uh monday morning
that would be united flight # # # # that flight is operated by united express air wisconsin and it leaves greenbay #:## a m arrives chicago ##:## connects with american flight # # # # again that's operated by american eagle leaving chicago ##:## and arriving springfield ##:## p m
uh that gives me half a day there wednesday that's good
ok and then you're going to return from chicago on the fourteen or
on the ##th right
at what time
um nan late afternoon evening
united has a #:## non-stop that arrives san francisco #:## or they have a five p m that arrives #:##
what's the next flight earlier than the the uh one that arrives
there's a #:## on american that arrives san francisco #:## or a # o'clock on united that arrives san francisco #:##
i think i'm going to do the # p m thing
m... monday the #st
ok that would be united
let me let me let me beg your pardon here for a second i want to pull a map do you have any distances easily available in your computer there
um just air mileage actually where were you thinking of from
well i want i've got i think it's either two or three hundred miles that i have to drive if i'm going to come into ord
from springfield
uh well no it's a different town but it's very very close to that
let me eh eh a ### airmiles from springfield to chicago

#:## and arrives san francisco #:##
and
you want me to price this and see what we get for the lowest available fare just one moment
all right this is two weeks in advance so it should be
yeah and you are staying over a saturday night so we should be able to do something here uh it's taking a moment not sure why ok i can send your united number to hertz also um i'm just looking at this fare we got back the lowest available would be ### and ## dollars round trip that is completely non-refundable and the last day to issue the ticket would be today because it has a fourteen day advance purchase
so that is that is the discounted fare then
yes and that's that's the the lowest
ok
ok
we would have to issue the ticket today and it would be completely non-refundable
aha
and if you want to go with that or we could look at er er portions of your trip going to change or would you like to look at a fare that has a
well barring some major catastrophe no it won't change
so would you like me to go ahead and set this up to ticket today
yes
ok and
i've i've always wondered if i get bumped on one of these legs because i am flying two different airlines is that going to foul up my ticketing
no if if for for their reasons you mean they
say american airlines
and i want to take whatever red eye or any other flight that i have to take to get there in time to make that transfer
oversold the flight or something
american eagle or whoever it is bumps me off a flight is united going to penalize me
no
ok ok that's real fine
all righty

aha
departing #:## from salt lake arrival san fran at ##:##
oh ##:##
hi this is b
yeah
ok
great thanks a lot
ok sure b thank you
aha bye bye
bye
i have a question um on the return flight on the sunday
aha
um if the #:## flight was available
ok let me take a look ok all right #:## on sunday the ##th
aha
i've got let's see yeah it still shows available if you want to book it
ok i assume it's the same as the other one in terms of price
good afternoon american express this is a
now she said that if we don't ticket if we do ticket the # # # # today and the... then we have to cancel that first fare
aha
there's a ### dollar fine
okay
and p... penalty plus uh we pay for the going rate
yeah if ther... if it's going to be a higher rate
it's going to be a higher rate ok now if we wait and the lufthansa flight does come up what rate do we get that ## ## or something close to that
well i don't know we can't predict what a fare is going to be if a fare if the computer's telling us that it's going to go higher we really can't tell you what it's going to go up to
oh
um
ok this is for b c's trip
for that lufthansa flight
yeah it doesn't tell us what it's going to be tomorrow
oh
all it's saying is the # # # # will expire today
oh i see
now let me um let me take a look at the rules possibly that would help me out a little bit ok so the rules for let's see for the um the fare quote from san francisco to frankfurt on the twa flight that he's on i'm trying to see if that's the one it looks like that might be the one that's holding whatever penalty let me take a look at it
that one it's from saint louis right
yeah let's see the that's the one that's holding the the ### dollar penalty
yeah she told me that
ut dut dut dut dut dut duh um it says ticket may be issued on or after yeah that looks like that's what it's um that's what it's holding is that but i don't know what um lemme look at the return and see if that might have something to do with it
oh c ok
he's coming back on lufthansa
yeah i see that let's see let's see what lufthansa's fare quote says
you know what a i was wondering since we had uh we wait-listed on the lufthansa when it does list when they list it there it is available why can't he get that ## ## whatever round trip you know or it was maybe like ## ## or something
you mean if the if the the uh wait list clears
yeah
we don't have any guarantee that it will clear
um actually you know i really don't know what uh what to tell you um
ok i think that'll i think the best thing to do is just ta... ge... go one way on that other one to guarantee his flight
yeah
of ## ## ok
and this is for his trip on uh september september to uh frankfurt germany
ok thanks a lot d
thank you bye
bye bye
mhm
ok now she said it had to be ticketed today for the ### #### dollar flight
right
ok and he still is wait-listed for that lufthansa flight
right

and going to arrange for you to collect your tickets from the train station

american express a speaking
at #:##
mhm
ok
and they have another flight at #:## a m that connects through atlanta which would get in at #:## fare is gonna be a lot higher for that one
which one the the
for the # ## a m departure
oh never mind then cos we're looking for the cheapest way
ok what day's he returning
the ##th that's a sunday
ok and about what time on the ##th
hi this is b c
and he said around # p m
ok one second doing a little pricing now i'll take just a second longer
all right
you said by the lowest fare available you we are talking like a non-refundable fare correct that would be uh something in the range of ### to ### round trip
### round trip
aha
ok now i want to ask you something else
now to tell you for the times on that keeping him on delta coming back
mhm
i'd have to keep him for that kind of fare i would have to keep him on the same fl... airline coming back as i sent him out on
hi b ok how can i help you
mhm
te... uh delta their last flight would be at #:## p m
mhm
in co... connecting through dallas would get in at #:## there are later flights but not on delta
ok that's fine uh he got some information from this conference he's going to
aha
and they have said that uh they they recommended somebody down in saint petersburg beach calling somebody down there to get a forty percent off a a domestic round trip coach fare
mhm well just to let you know what the coach fare is there
yeah
one second normally the conference rates do offer some discount like that
um doctor d spelled d like in and he needs to leave early in the morning and he doesn't know a flight number or a time
mhm
but it's not as usually as good as taking the uh the penalty fare
mhm
coach fare is #### dollars
mmm
uh so ## percent of that would be
### dollars
### dollars
yeah aha ok and it i they also included here a delta file code number
aha we we can use that if you want to go ahead for the conference rate
ok where's he going from to
we can
i i would need that code number to apply for that conference rate
ok but then that's ### dollars more than this non-refundable
it is true there is no penalty attached to the conference rate
aha
uh whereas th... this non-refundable is non-refundable but if it's you know it is ### dollars more if he can uh go with the penalty he's going to come out ahead with the um the non-conference rate
but i could i could still give you this delta file code number and and i could do it through you instead of having to deal with these people down in saint petersburg beach
that is correct
ok great well i'm going to throw this past him and i'll get back to you later today
ok now
he's going from san francisco to tampa's um saint pete's

c you know i have to get a travel advance can i give you a call right back
sure no problem and which day would mr b like to travel
um he's departing on june ##th going from san jose to burbank leaving at #:## p m
ok and returning on which day
uh june ##th
american express travel this is a
right aha ok uh i actually am going to i think be buying a ticket for someone else and so i need to know some time periods can you help me with that
sure what um
this p... this will be from traver city michigan to sfo
what date is it for
the ##th of august and i'd like an open return but it would probably be something like the uh ##th of september
ok now if you have open return you're not going to get the lowest fare the lowest require a confirmed return
oh i see
cos they're all subject to what days you're travelling and they have to be confirmed with an open return uh you would be paying as high as let me get that ### one way
ooh
so you have to have a confirmed return to get the lowest fares
hi this is b c www
ok that ### dollars one way
one way right aha
and if it's confirmed
i ne... i need to know the dates days of the week
uh say the ##th of september ok
ok the lowest airfare would be ### round trip that's a non-refundable non-changeable ticket you have to make the reservation er buy the ticket within ## hours after reservations are made the very latest you can make reservations and buy tickets would be ## days uh before departure and that would be subject to the fares being available
i see uh well gee that certaily a big difference in price isn't it
right right it's real restrictive too so once you buy it they can't change anything on it you use it or lose it
ok and there's nothing in between th... even with uh confirmed date that would allow for a cancellation at anytime before the
well not not on the only fare that allows you that is the # ## so if you have um there's a ## percent penalty ticket uh let me get that fare but you still have to use it round trip um you'd have to make your re... changes # days before the new date or pay a ### dollar fare to come home
aha
uh
so all all of the fares are real restrictive now today so let me see what the ## percent penalty ticket would be
what airline is this
that's american or northwest the two carriers service that
ok and and it's the same no matter if if we changed to united
same same re... they're all the same they all are competitive with one another so the fares are the same
ok so it's northwest or american and it goes traver city to chicago o'hare
well it depends on who you're using northwest will go through detroit and united will go through actually united doesn't service united is no you can't use united they don't service traver city so it would have to be american or northwest
ok and american goes through chicago
that's correct aha
do you still provide the personal service of making reservations for www employees for air reservation
ok well i guess i have some thinking to do and some questions to ask
ok thank you very much for your help
you're welcome ok
bye
goodbye
aha
yes aha
ok and this is for personal travel
right airline reservations
aha
may i speak to mmm please
he hasn't he hasn't filled out the form probably in any case they're available in the travel office if he does want to fill one out
ok and let's see i need his employee number please
nan
ok and the charge number for the trip
nan
whoops ok and his travel advance number
nan all righty and let's see what is the date of travel going to be
july ##th
from where to where
he's going to go san francisco to newark and he would like to arrive in newark around # o'clock at night and he would request an united flight
yeah hello hi it's a with american express travel
ok the closest thing i have to arriving at that time would be a flight leaving at #:## from san francisco arrival time in newark would be #:## other than that united would have a flight arriving at #:##
that sounds just fine the #:## flight
the #:## a m ok and that would be non-stop what about would he be continuing on or returning home
uh we're just going to leave it with an open return
ok so we're not going to make a resevation or you want me to ticket something with an open ticket
yes please give him the ticket and that way all he has to do when he gets back to newark is to have them plunk in a number
ok and does he have a specific um an approximate date i should put in here
it could be anywhere from # to # weeks
oh ok then why don't i say um
well just give him a full fare coach and don't worry about it ok we just have to put in um a um a fake fake date in there so it reads it ok all righty then let me give you the round trip fare for that it's #### is the lowest fare that we could confirm it's a non-penalty fare of course and let's uh
great um i need to make some reservations for two people
sounds pretty good i think the last time the guy told him it was almost ## hundred
really
yeah
that's uh that's fairly uh fairly low in fact the outbound flight is pricing at a discounted fare without um without any penalty so that's probably why it's so and let me get him his seat assignments what type would he prefer for united the flight out
uh i think can we hold off the seat assignments for about a half an hour and i'll get hold of him
yes sure
cos i
ok sure that's no problem does he
and we have to do one more
did you get a hotel or information or anything like that
ok is it going to be for domestic travel
nope and they don't need a car either
ok so let me put in um that we don't need that ok when do you want the tickets issued um that's not a
do it on monday
problem for us ok i'm just confirming his fare right now and then we'll go to the next one ok who's the other traveller going to be
he's one of our machinists so i know you don't have a profile on him ggg hhh and
yeah
and his employee number nan
same charge number
yep nan
ok and his travel advance number
yes it is
nan
ok
are you i'm sorry
ok and it's going to be the same uh the same itinerary
yes please
and also uh open return
uh he has asked if it wouldn't be any problem if he can have a newark to los angeles open return
sure that's no problem i'll go ahead and issue that and uh let's see ok that round trip um so to speak round trip with open return is #### so it's lower to go to la i guess
wow
and that's again non-penalty and everything is confirmed for that do you have his seating request by any chance
ok um who is the first traveller going to be
i will call him right now
ok and no hotel no car
can i put you on hold for just a sec
sure sure
thank you
well it's a good thing i checked with him he has changed his plans
oh
open return should be san f... to san francisco not la
ok sure then let me um
yeah he thinks a smoking window would be great
ccc ddd
smoking window ok then i'll go ahead let me request that on uh united flight ##
and ccc ddd is there any chance we can get the two of them together
sure let me take a look and see what we've got
great
well looks like the best i could do would be um only two aisles there's no windows in n... smoking available so i could put them in one seat in front of the other or i could put them in uh two aisles with a middle seat between them in the central section of the p... of the flight cos the the two seats and there are three seats in the center of the plane and then two seats again and within the three seat section i could put them both on an aisle seat and there'd be a middle seat that's empty between them right now
hang on just a sec um oh this is tough isn't it
yeah there's unfortunately there are no um aisles across from each other this way they would just have be in the middle section there i can't guarantee that no one will be sitting between them but middle seats are usually the last last seats to be assigned
can can we go to the center section of three seats and get them two side by side
sure one will be in the middle ok one on the aisle i'll do that then i'll put them in ## c and ## or er ## d
great
all righty let me pull up the profile for him ok we don't have a profile for him he must uh is he a new traveller or
ok
ok
all right bye everything's set and um nnn will give you a call on monday when they're both uh ready to be picked up
great
ok
thank you very much
